 Abhinav Gorantla is a Computer Science graduate student at [Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/).

## Education
* **Master of Science** in Computer Science [Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/), 2025 (expected)
* **Bachelor of Technology** in Computer Science and Engineering, [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), 2023

## Experience
* August 2024 - Now: Graduate Research Assistant at Emitlab, [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, ASU](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/)
  * Working on developing an optimized algorithm to retrieve Skylines in relational database systems efficiently.
  * Supporting researchers at CASCADE Lab in maintaining and developing[causalbench.org](https://causalbench.org).

* August 2024 - Now: Graduate Teaching Assistant at Emitlab, [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, ASU](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/)
  * Teaching Assistant for the graduate level course, CSE515 - Multimedia and Web Databases taught by Prof. K. Selcuk Candan. 
  * Held bi-weekly office hours.
  * Organized project demos and helped students with the projects.

* March 2024 – August 2024: Graduate Services Assistant at Emitlab, [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, ASU](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/)
  * Supported researchers at CASCADE Lab in their efforts to build the causalbench python package and website to create an end-to-end benchmarking solution for researchers in the field on causally informed machine learning.
  * Served as a full stack developer in the CausalBench project, a framework for benchmarking causal machine learning algorithms.
  * Engineered and optimized backend architecture for the Skysong project to enhance data flow efficiency and boost server response time by 80%. Also reduced the cost of deploying the system by 30% by integrating AWS Sagemaker into the system.

## Projects

1. **Research Publications Analysis tool**
   - Proposed an architecture and built a research publications analysis tool for ASU. This tool was built as a web application which could fetch research paper information affiliated with ASU using SCOPUS APIs and perform a text analysis on their abstracts.
   - Reduced the server response time by 80% and improved the user experience by integrating RabbitMQ message queues in the system.
   - **Tech stack used:** ReactJS, NodeJS, Python-FastAPI, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, AWS S3, AWS Sagemaker, OpenAI APIs.
2. **Multimodal Image Retrieval System using Advanced Feature Analysis and Search Techniques**
   - Developed a Python-based image retrieval engine encompassing feature extraction from Caltech101 dataset images, latent semantics computation, clustering, and classification.
   - Employed Locality Sensitive Hashing to index image features, optimizing nearest neighbor searches and ensuring scalability for expansive image datasets.

## Projects

1. [Time Series forecasting using Enhanced GAFs](#)
   - Applied Gramian Angular Fields to encode time series data, integrating it with a CNN for precise predictions on stock trends—assessing whether they would follow an upward or downward trajectory.

2. [agCLI](https://github.com/AbhinavGor/agCLI){:target="_blank"}
   - Used Node.js, Commander.js, octokit.js, the GitHub API to build a command line tool which can update all the npm packages in a project and make a pull request to the GitHub repository with the version updates.

3. [Spell Checker using TRIE Trees](https://github.com/AbhinavGor/Spell-Checker-Using-TRIE-Trees){:target="_blank"}
   - Implemented BK Trees, TRIE Trees, and Hash Tables data structures in C++ and provided a comparative study on their performance with respect to auto suggestions and correction of words. Developed as a command-line tool.

4. [The Weekly Edge](https://github.com/AbhinavGor/tweBackendv1){:target="_blank"}
   - Built a back-end REST API with CRUD operations to post, edit, and view articles written by members at THEPC - VIT. Maintained this MERN stack project for 1.5 years, introducing features like favoriting articles and a security question feature.

5. [Automatic Essay Grader using NLP](https://github.com/abhinavgor/ai-essay-autograd){:target="_blank"}
   - Built an NLP pipeline to extract various features from an essay like cosine similarity, Latent Semantic Analysis, TF IDF scores, and Orthography (spell checking). Used different Machine Learning Algorithms for scoring essays, with a comparative analysis.

6. [Smart Parking Architecture using IoT](https://github.com/AbhinavGor/Smart-Parking-System---IoT-Project){:target="_blank"}
   - IoT project during junior year at VIT. Enabled parking spaces to run automatically without human interference. Proposed architecture and details can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-s5y2Cf95go4HA1bf-WU8jk31cO4_1c2/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. -->

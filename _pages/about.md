## Projects

1. **Research Publications Analysis tool**
   - Proposed an architecture and built a research publications analysis tool for ASU. This tool was built as a web application which could fetch research paper information affiliated with ASU using SCOPUS APIs and perform a text analysis on their abstracts.
   - Reduced the server response time by 80% and improved the user experience by integrating RabbitMQ message queues in the system.
   - **Tech stack used:** ReactJS, NodeJS, Python-FastAPI, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, AWS S3, AWS Sagemaker, OpenAI APIs.
2. **Multimodal Image Retrieval System using Advanced Feature Analysis and Search Techniques**
   - Developed a Python-based image retrieval engine encompassing feature extraction from Caltech101 dataset images, latent semantics computation, clustering, and classification.
   - Employed Locality Sensitive Hashing to index image features, optimizing nearest neighbor searches and ensuring scalability for expansive image datasets.
